The Applied Hydroclimatology Group at Dartmouth explores the physical mechanisms and impacts of climate variability and change with a focus on climate-agriculture interactions, the changing climate of the Northeastern United States, and the sustainability of irrigated agriculture.

## About
The Applied Hydroclimatology Group at Dartmouth explores the physical mechanisms and impacts of climate variability and change with a 
focus on climate-agriculture interactions, the changing climate of the Northeastern United States, and the sustainability of irrigated agriculture.

### Research

Agriculture is inherently vulnerable to a changing climate. Climate-smart management decisions have the ability to improve agriculture’s adaptive 
capacity and potentially mitigate climate change impacts. We aim to inform agricultural and decision support models through analyzing historical 
climate variability, developing future climate scenarios, and exploring the relationship between agricultural systems and local climate.
